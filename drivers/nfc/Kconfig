config NFC_TRF7970A
	tristate "Texas Instruments TRF7970a NFC driver"
	depends on SPI && NFC_DIGITAL && GPIOLIB
	help
	  This option enables the NFC driver for Texas Instruments' TRF7970a
	  device. Such device supports 5 different protocols: ISO14443A,
	  ISO14443B, FeLiCa, ISO15693 and ISO18000-3.

	  Say Y here to compile support for TRF7970a into the kernel or
	  say M  to compile it as a module. The module will be called
	  trf7970a.ko.

config NFC_MEI_PHY
	tristate "MEI bus NFC device support"
	depends on INTEL_MEI && NFC_HCI
	help
	  This adds support to use an mei bus nfc device. Select this if you
	  will use an HCI NFC driver for an NFC chip connected behind an
	  Intel's Management Engine chip.

	  If unsure, say N.

config NFC_SIM
	tristate "NFC hardware simulator driver"
	depends on NFC_DIGITAL
	help
	  This driver declares two virtual NFC devices supporting NFC-DEP
	  protocol. An LLCP connection can be established between them and
	  all packets sent from one device is sent back to the other, acting as
	  loopback devices.

	  If unsure, say N.

config NFC_PORT100
	tristate "Sony NFC Port-100 Series USB device support"
	depends on USB
	depends on NFC_DIGITAL
	help
	  This adds support for Sony Port-100 chip based USB devices such as the
	  RC-S380 dongle.

	  If unsure, say N.

config NFC_VIRTUAL_NCI
	tristate "NCI device simulator driver"
	depends on NFC_NCI
	help
	  NCI virtual device simulates a NCI device to the user.
	  It can be used to validate the NCI module and applications.
	  This driver supports communication between the virtual NCI device and
	  module.

	  If unsure, say N.

config NXP_NFC_I2C
	tristate "NXP NCI based NFC I2C Slave Driver for SNxxx"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  This enables the NFC driver for SNxxx based devices.
	  This is for I2C connected version. NCI protocol logic
	  resides in the usermode and it has no other NFC dependencies.

	  If unsure, say N.

config NXP_ESE_P73
	tristate "Nxp P73 secure element protocol driver (SPI) devices"
	depends on SPI && NXP_NFC_I2C
	help
	  This enables the Secure Element driver for SNxxx based devices.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  This selects Secure Element support.

	  If you want NFC support, you should say Y here and
	  also to your specific host controller driver.
